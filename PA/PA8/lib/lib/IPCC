INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in the year 1988 by the
World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP). It is an intergovernmental body that is open to all member countries of the UNEP and of
WMO. Each government has an IPCC focal point that coordinates IPCC related activities in the
country. Relevant international, intergovernmental or non-governmental organizations are also
participating in the work of the IPCC
The IPCC Plenary
The IPCC meets approximately once a year at the plenary level of government representatives. The
sessions are attended by hundreds of officials and experts from relevant ministries, agencies and
research institutions from member countries and from participating organisations. All major decisions
are taken by the Panel in plenary session such as on IPCC’s principles, procedures and structure, mandate
of working groups and task forces, workplan and budget. The Panel decides whether to prepare
a new report, its scope and outline, and it accepts reports. It elects also the IPCC Chair and the Bureau.

The IPCC Bureau
Members of the IPCC Bureau are normally
elected for the duration of the preparation of an
IPCC Assessment Report (5-6 years). They
should be experts in the field of climate change
and all regions should be represented in the
IPCC Bureau. The Bureau is chaired by the Chair
of the IPCC and is composed of the Co-Chairs of
the three IPCC Working Groups and the Task
Force Bureau on National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories, IPCC Vice-Chairs and Vice-Chairs of
the Working Groups. Presently the IPCC Bureau
has 30 members.
The IPCC Working Groups
IPCC Working Groups and any Task Force of the
IPCC have clearly defined mandates and work
plans agreed by the Panel and are led by two Cochairs.
IPCC Working Groups at the plenary level
of government representatives agree on the
scope of a report prepared by the respective working
group, provide guidance on the selection of
authors and later accept the content of the report
and approve its Summary for Policymakers. The
reports are prepared by teams of authors (see
later), but governments are invited to provide
comments during government reviews.

According to the current working group structure
Working Group I assesses the scientific aspects
of the climate system and climate change;
Working Group II assesses the scientific, technical,
environmental, economic and social
aspects of the vulnerability (sensitivity and
adaptability) to climate change of, and the negative
and positive consequences (impacts) for,
ecological systems, socio-economic sectors and
human health, with an emphasis on regional,
sectoral and cross-sectoral issues;
Working Group III assesses the scientific, technical,
environmental, economic and social
aspects of the mitigation of climate change.
The Task Force on National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories
The Task Force is mandated to carry out work on
inventory-related methodologies and practices. The
Bureau of the Task Force is elected by the Panel, but
only the Co-chairs of the Task Force Bureau are
members of the IPCC Bureau. Reports prepared by
the Task Force are accepted by the Panel.

Authors, contributors,
reviewers and other experts
Hundreds of experts from all over the world are
contributing to the preparation of IPCC reports
as authors, contributors and reviewers. They
are selected by the Working Group Bureaux
from nominations received from governments
and participating organisations or identified
directly because of their special expertise
reflected in their publications and works. The
composition of lead author teams for chapters
of IPCC reports shall reflect a range of views,
expertise and geographical representation.
Coordinating Lead Authors take overall responsibility
for coordinating major sections of a
report. Lead Authors are responsible for the
production of designated sections of reports.
The essence of the lead authors’task is synthesis
of the best scientific, technical and socioeconomic
information available in peerreviewed
and internationally available literature
and in selected non-peer reviewed literature.
They are also required, in conjunction with
Review Editors, to take account of expert and
government review comments in revising the
text. Lead Authors may enlist Contributing
Authors, who will prepare technical information
on specific topics to be assimilated in the chapter.
Experts may also be invited to contribute to
the IPCC process through participation in expert
meetings and workshops.
In the course of two reviews Expert Reviewers
are invited to comment on the accuracy and
completeness of the scientific/technical/socioeconomic
content and the overall balance of
the drafts. During the second review
Governments are also invited to comment on
the revised drafts. The names of all authors,
reviewers and review editors are acknowledged
in the report.

The IPCC Secretariat
The IPCC Secretariat plans, oversees and manages
all IPCC activities. In particular the IPCC
Secretariat organises sessions of the Panel,
the IPCC Bureau and Working Groups, and
other IPCC activities in co-operation with the
Technical Support Units (TSU), manages the
IPCC Trust Fund and oversees and co-ordinates
IPCC publication, public information and
outreach activities. It is supported by UNEP
and WMO and hosted by WMO at its
Headquarters in Geneva/Switzerland.

The activities of each IPCC Working Group and
of the Task Force on Inventories are supported
by Technical Support Units (TSU). The government

assumes the primary responsibility for funding
the TSU, which is normally hosted by a
research institute in that country. The
