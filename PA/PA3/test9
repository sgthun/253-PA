Special pattern characters are characters (or sequences of characters) that have a special meaning when they appear in a regular expression pattern, either to represent a character that is difficult to express in a string, or to represent a category of characters. Each of these special pattern characters is matched in the target sequence against a single character (unless a quantifier specifies otherwise).
