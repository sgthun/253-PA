[1] Trefethen NA-net posting of 9 May 1993


From: Nick Trefethen

Subject: Classic Papers in Numerical Analysis

                  "CLASSIC PAPERS IN NUMERICAL ANALYSIS"

NA-Netters may be interested to hear of my experiences this spring teaching a
seminar with the above title to a dozen Cornell graduate students (three of
whom were actually post-docs or faculty).  Comp. Sci. 722 met once a week for
two hours, and in the course of the semester we read thirteen papers:

   1. Cooley & Tukey (1965)              the Fast Fourier Transform
   2. Courant, Friedrichs & Lewy (1928)  finite difference methods for PDE 
   3. Householder (1958)                 QR factorization of matrices
   4. Curtiss & Hirschfelder (1952)      stiffness of ODEs; BD formulas
   5. de Boor (1972)                     calculations with B-splines
   6. Courant (1943)                     finite element methods for PDE
   7. Golub & Kahan (1965)               the singular value decomposition
   8. Brandt (1977)                      multigrid algorithms
   9. Hestenes & Stiefel (1952)          the conjugate gradient iteration
  10. Fletcher & Powell (1963)           optimization via quasi-Newton updates
  11. Wanner, Hairer & Norsett (1978)    order stars and applications to ODE
  12. Karmarkar (1984)                   interior pt. methods for linear prog.
  13. Greengard & Rokhlin (1987)         multipole methods for particles

Most weeks, one or two related readings were also assigned, typically from a 
recent textbook or survey article.  For example, along with the Fletcher &
Powell paper we read an extract from the 1983 text by Dennis & Schnabel.

Our weekly meetings followed a regular format.  First, this week's Historian
distributed a handout containing information he/she had obtained about the
historical context of the paper, including biographical information about the
author(s) and a plot of citations as a function of time.  Next, the
Mathematician gave a presentation of some of the central ideas of the paper.
Third and fourth, two Experimentalists reported the results of Matlab, C, or
Fortran experiments conducted to illustrate some of the properties of the
algorithm under discussion.  Finally, the Professor added a few remarks.

To me and at least some of the students, this course provided a satisfying
vision of the broad scope of numerical analysis and a sense of excitement at
what a diversity of beautiful and powerful ideas have been invented in this
field.  The thirteen papers were selected partly for their variety; they touch
upon nearly all the main problems of numerical computation.  We found that
although they vary greatly in style, most are quite readable.  Indeed it was a
pleasure, week after week, to be in the hands of the masters.  These authors
are for the most part extraordinary people, including some about whom most
numerical analysts know little (such as Hirschfelder, one of the leading
American chemists of this century).

We were struck by how young many of the authors were when they wrote these
papers (average age: 34), and by how short an influential paper can be
(Householder: 3.3 pages, Cooley & Tukey: 4.4).  Our readings also uncovered a
few surprises.  For example, Curtiss and Hirschfelder inexplicably define
stiffness in terms of exponentially diverging trajectories, not converging
ones; nevertheless they invent the right cure for the problem in the shape of
backward differentiation formulas.  For another example, did you know that the
classic SVD paper by Golub & Kahan makes no mention of the QR algorithm?

Our thirteen papers fall into three categories:

          Finite algorithms for finite problems: papers 1,3,5
      Infinite algorithms for infinite problems: papers 2,4,6,7,10,11
        Infinite algorithms for finite problems: papers 8,9,12,13

(An infinite algorithm is one that depends on an iteration or discretization
parameter; an infinite problem is one for which all exact algorithms must be
infinite.)  The third category is particularly interesting.  Evidently four of
the most exciting modern developments in numerical analysis -- multigrid
iterations, conjugate gradient iterations, interior point methods, and
multipole methods -- have in common that they depend on the approximate
computation of quantities that might in principle be computed exactly. 

Most readers of this note will have thought of other classic authors and papers
that should have been on the list.  We agree!  We are saving up ideas for the
next run of CS 722 in a couple of years.

Instructor: Nick Trefethen, Upson 4148,
	    255-4222, LNT@cs.cornell.edu

Meetings: one two-hour meeting each week at a time and place to be determined

Prerequisites: (1) ideally, at least two of CS 621, 622, 624 or their
equivalents; and\hb
\hbox{\phantom{Prerequisites: }(2) a serious commitment to numerical analysis.}

All students, even those on reduced tuition, must register to take the
course for a grade (i.e., no auditors).  The grade will
be A for those students who remain involved with the course throughout
the semester and contribute to its success.  Non-students may also participate
provided they agree to act like students.

There will be thirteen weekly meetings, each organized around
a classic paper and related readings.
Each student should read all the readings each week and be prepared to
participate in discussions.  

Our aim each week will be to have a lively discussion and a good time.
Each week's meeting will be organized about the following principal players:
\par
\ss

{\leftskip 1.5in\parskip=3pt\obeylines
The {\bf Historian}
The {\bf Mathematician}
Two {\bf Experimentalists}
The {\bf Professor} (L.N.~Trefethen, ex officio)
}
\vfill

A rough agenda will be as follows:

\def\item #1. (#2) {\par\hangindent 0 pt\hangafter=0\indent
		    \llap{#1. }($\approx #2$~mins.) }
\def\itemeach #1. (#2) {\par\hangindent 0 pt\hangafter=0\indent
		    \llap{#1. }($\approx #2$~mins.~each)~~}
\vfill

\item 1. (15)  The Historian will distribute to the class a handout containing
information he/she has obtained about the historical context of the paper.
This handout should include a plot of citations as a function of time
(e.g.\ from the
{\sl Science Citation Index.})~~Examples of other interesting information might
be the original review in {\sl Math.~Reviews\/} or the
{\sl Zentralblatt f\"ur Mathematik,}
biographical entries from {\sl Who's Who,} obituaries from the
{\sl New York Times,}
historical remarks found in numerical analysis textbooks,
results of a conversation with a relevant Cornell faculty member,
a survey of impact on software libraries, etc.

\item 2. (30) The Mathematician is responsible for reading the main
paper with exceptional care.  Ideally, he/she will understand all the
details of the paper, though it is recognized that this will not always
be possible.
His/her assignment is to speak with the class about the technical aspects of
the paper.  Depending on his/her inclinations, this might
take the form of a systematic lecture presentation or of a guided discussion
of certain interesting points.

\itemeach 3,$\,$4. (15) During the week, each Experimentalist
will have played with this week's topic on the computer.  In most cases
this can best be done in Matlab.  He/she is responsible for preparing a handout
with plots and/or numbers that will form the basis of a class discussion.
In certain cases it may be appropriate simply to perform experiments
illustrating the results obtained in the paper.  In other cases it is
hoped the Experimentalists will explore nontrivial applications or
unexplained phenomena.

\item 5. (15) Finally, the Professor will add whatever comments he deems
appropriate.
\vfill

Some of the roles above may sometimes be played by pairs of students
rather than individuals.  In particular, it may be more fun for an
Experimentalist to be a pair rather than a solo.

This agenda is just a proposal---I am open to suggestions for changes.
